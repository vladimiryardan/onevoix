# Realtime with WebSockets
__Presented By [Giancarlo Gomez](https://github.com/GiancarloGomez)__

This is the demo code used in my Realtime with WebSockets presentation. This code base includes the following examples.

* __[Advanced Socket](https://github.com/GiancarloGomez/AdvancedSocket "AdvancedSockets Repo")__
<br />Simple JavaScript Utility that can be used to extend ColdFusion's WebSocket connection to be able to check for connectivity issues, display status messages and handle reconnections.
* __[Console](https://github.com/GiancarloGomez/ColdFusion-WebSockets-Console "Console Repo")__
<br />An updated/enhanced version of the [ColdFusion Team's original demo code](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/developing-applications/coldfusion-and-html-5/using-coldfusion-websocket/using-websocket-to-broadcast-messages.html) to work with WebSockets. This can be dropped into any Application to test your WebSocket configuration.
* __Demo Code__
	* Clients (Simple and Advanced Socket)
	* Chat App
	* Server Broadcast
	* Server Connected Clients (simple dump)
	* Simple Stats Console

All slides for each time the presentation was given.
